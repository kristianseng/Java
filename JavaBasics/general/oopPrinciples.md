1) Abstraction.  

abstraction - splitting something large and monolithic into several small parts.  
From a programmer's perspective, **abstraction is properly dividing a program into objects.**  
Abstraction lets you pick out an object's main characteristics and omit anything less important.  


2) Encapsulation.  

Encapsulation is intended to improve the interaction between objects by simplifying them.  
**In terms of programming, encapsulation is «hiding the implementation»**  

3) Inheritance.  
 
4) Polymorphism.  

polymorphism lets us interact with objects of different classes (usually with a common ancestor) in the same way. 
The significance of this can't be overemphasized. It becomes more important as a program grows larger.
