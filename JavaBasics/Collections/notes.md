**List** in Java provides **ordered and indexed collection** which **may contain duplicates**. 

**Set** interface provides an **unordered** collection that **doesn't allow duplicates**.

**Map** provides a data structure based on **key-value pair and hashing**.
















**Null elements** :

The list allows null elements and you can have many null objects in a List because it also allowed duplicates. Set just allow one null element as there is no duplicate permitted while in Map you can have null values and at most one null key. 

Worth noting is that Hashtable doesn't allow null key or values but HashMap allows null values and one null key.  This is also the main difference between these two popular implementations of Map interface, aka HashMap vs Hashtable.
